        <p> The rhythms of the brain are layered; and they broadly vary in frequency.
        <br>
        <br>The Ultradian rhythm occurs every ninety to one-hundred and ten minutes, that's around 15 to 16 times per Circadian cycle (the 20 hour period ± 4 hours).
        <br>
        <br>The Circadian rhythm we are more familiar with.  Every day we are called to sleep.
        <br>
        <br>The Infridian rhythm occurs every twenty eight hours.
        <br>
        <br>The Circaseptan spans about one week.
        <br>
        <br>The Circadiseptan spans for about two weeks.
        <br>
        <br>The Circatrigintan happens about twelve times a year.
        <br>
        <br>The Circa Annual rhythm happens once a year.

        <p>While the left hemisphere does play a larger role in our use of language, and the right with our creativity, these are more modalities that we switch between than they are dominant states that we have to stick with to succeed. Most activity in the brain takes place across multiple structures and systems.</p>
        <p> Josh Waitzkin was a chess prodigy. You might remember his story from The film Searching for Bobby Fischer, which loosely was based on his childhood.  After the intense competitions of his youth, Waitzkin moved to the martial arts (Taiji), and took those competitions by storm, beginning in 2004 with his Push Hands victory, winning the world championship.  His career continued into other martial arts, and other competitive arenas.  What was his secret?</p>
        <p>Waitzkin trained himself to take full advantage of the dual cycle, something he learned in his youth playing chess.  When deep concentration is required, deep intervals of rest are required too.  Waitzkin increased the frequency of this cycle, providing instant hyper-relaxed intervals to prepare for intervals of explosive concentration.  Many martial arts seek this explosive cognitive (or sometimes spiritual) presence, and many approaches are used to attain it, depending on one's school.  Waitzkin's technique is straight forward.  It was also Behaviouralism in action, as is required by such disciplines.  He conditioned his mind to do these things through stimulus and response; through repetition.</p>
        <p>These short intervals in which the brain plays hot potato with which hemisphere needs stimulation are Ultradian in nature.
        The Ultradian rhythm occurs every ninety to one-hundred and ten minutes, that's around 15 to 16 times per Circadian cycle (the 20 hour period ± 4 hours). (Jensen, 2008). This estimate likely emerges from the more general use of the term Ultradian rhythm, which is any any rhythm whose frequency is shorter than 24 hours, and longer than 1 hour. So, any cycle or psychological process with a wavelength shorter than 24 hours, and greater than one hour could be classified an Ultradian rhythm.</p>
        <p>"A rule of thumb is we can focus on a task for approximately the length of time (in minutes) equal to our age, with some variance of course." (Jensen and McConchie, 2020) While a child in the second grade may have an average attention span of seven minutes, and a college freshman may have an average attention span of nineteen minutes, according to the text twenty minutes is the normal limit. There are always outliers.  But, have we really prioritized improving those limits as a society?  The first place I would look to suss out those outliers, is in how much effort they've put into their conditioning for either deep or extended concentration versus how much the average human puts into that conditioning.</p>
        <p>Video games are a fascinating arena for testing psychological and cognitive processes. Kokkinakis et al. (2017) explored correlations between apparent skill in a massive online battle arena (MOBA) genre game.  They found only a minor correlation between fluid intelligence (working memory) and player scores in this arena game; however, it was unclear whether fluid intelligence influenced game performance, or if game performance simply utilizes the same resources as other intelligence measurement instruments. </p>
