					</section>

					<section class="quote"><p>1) Every student in the classroom is important and worthy of respect. 
						Recognizing that teaching is fundamentally about building lives (Tompkins, 1996), 
						the teacher is consistently conscious of the value of each life and consistently seeks 
						to dignify each student in individual interactions and in front of the group as a whole.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="quote"><p>1) Example</p>
					</section>
					<section class="quote">2) A classroom environment that maximizes student potential reflects 
						a high regard for the individuals in it, high challenge, and high support. Classroom 
						environments that support the hard work and risk of learning begin with positive and 
						growing connections between the teacher and each student, leading to a clear sense 
						of team or community among the members of the class.
					</section>
					<section class="quote">2) Example
					</section>

					<section class="quote">3) Every student in the class should have access to a high-quality curriculum. 
						The teacher’s job is to ensure that every student works with and masters essential 
						knowledge, understanding, and skills at a level that enables the student to retain, 
						apply and transfer what is essential in the content. Therefore, the teacher works to 
						ensure that each student regularly engages with a curriculum that is inviting and 
						that calls on the student to understand and reason.
					</section>
					<section class="quote">3) Example
					</section>

					<section class="quote">4) Students in a given class will differ in readiness, interest,
						 and learning profile in ways that affect learning. These differences are influenced
						  by a variety of factors and are both normal and valuable. Students learn best when
						   teaching accounts for their various readiness levels, particular interests, and 
						   preferred ways of learning.
					</section>
					<section class="quote">4) Example
				   </section>

					<section class="quote">5) The teacher’s job is to study the differences and to respond 
						to them in ways that maximize student growth. Understanding students’ evolving learning 
						needs is as central to a teacher’s success as understanding the content to be taught.
					</section>
					<section class="quote">5) Example
					</section>

					<section class="quote">6) The classroom belongs to everyone in it in terms of both 
						opportunity and responsibility. Making the classroom work for everyone will 
						require contributions from everyone.
					</section>
					<section class="quote">6) Example
					</section>

					<section class="quote">7) Teachers and students alike should have a shared vision 
						of a classroom that works for everyone. As the architect of the vision, the 
						teacher must lead the students in understanding, appreciating, refining, extending, 
						implementing, and evaluating the vision.
