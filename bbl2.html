        <p>These are the basic regions of the brain for the purpose of introduction to anatomy and brain based learning, though each major section contains numerous other structures and systems that would be worth learning for metacognitive purposes, even if Jensen and McConchie (2020) said naming specific geographies of the brain isn't always the most useful exercise while teaching.</p>
        <p>Some lateralization does occur in some cognitive processes in the brain, however, to say that one hemisphere is the domain of personality, or learning style is simply a neuro-myth.
        The prefrontal cortex, located in the frontal lobe, is something like a grand construction project that takes around twenty five years to complete. Our ability to feel empathy is not fully realized until this structure is bridged by the Corpus Callosum, which allows either side of the frontal lobe to communicate.</p>
        <p>Hearing is laterally mirrored; that is to say, when air vibrates in our left ear, it is the right temporal lobe that processes the information. Left and Right handedness has no correlation with brain dominance. This is worth studying because in centuries past left handed people across the world were persecuted or classified other in numerous circumstances.  Even today, left handed people live in a right handed world.  The prevalence of brain dominance theory has left the public largely misinformed about how their brains work.</p>
        <p>While the left hemisphere does play a larger role in our use of language, and the right with our creativity, these are more modalities that we switch between than they are dominant states that we have to stick with to succeed. Most activity in the brain takes place across multiple structures and systems.</p>
        <p>Drag the brain around to compare the basic positions of the lobes and their fissures (division lines). It may take some time for the brain to load, depending on your internet connection. The colored boxes below describe some of the processes involved with these lobes.  You will find references at the bottom of the page.</p>
